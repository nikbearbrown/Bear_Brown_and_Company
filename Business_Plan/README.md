# Creating a Business Plan and Prototype for Startup Onboarding

**IMPORTANT: We cannot onboard folks without a basic prototype (that works on localhost) and a basic business plan.**

A comprehensive business plan alongside a functional prototype is essential for any startup seeking onboarding support. This guide emphasizes both the technical demonstration requirements and business planning aspects most critical for early-stage companies:

## Prerequisite: Basic Working Prototype

Before proceeding with the business plan, ensure you have:
- A functional prototype that demonstrates your core value proposition
- Working code that can be run locally (on localhost)
- Documentation for setup and basic operations
- Clear demonstration of key features that solve your stated problem
- Screenshots or demo video for reference

## 1. Executive Summary
- Craft a concise, compelling overview of your business concept
- **Highlight your Unique Value Proposition (UVP) prominently** - this is the single most important element that sets you apart
- Introduce your team's relevant expertise and track record of success
- Reference your working prototype and how it validates your concept

## 2. Problem Statement
- Clearly articulate the specific problem your business solves
- Use data to quantify the problem's scope and importance
- Explain why existing solutions are inadequate
- Describe how your prototype addresses this specific problem

## 3. Solution and UVP Development
- **Detail your solution with crystal-clear language** - avoid industry jargon
- Articulate why your approach is innovative and superior
- Demonstrate how your solution creates meaningful value for customers
- Include technical details about how your prototype implements this solution

## 4. Team Analysis
- Showcase founders' relevant experience, education, and achievements
- Highlight previous successful ventures or exits
- Emphasize domain expertise and technical capabilities that give your team unique insight
- Identify key skills gaps and how you plan to address them

## 5. Market Research
- Define your Total Addressable Market (TAM), Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM), and Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)
- Identify key market trends supporting your business thesis
- Analyze target customer segments and their needs

## 6. Competitive Analysis
- Map the competitive landscape
- Identify direct and indirect competitors
- Clearly articulate your competitive advantages
- Explain barriers to entry that protect your business
- Compare your prototype's capabilities to existing solutions

## 7. Business Model
- Outline how you'll generate revenue
- Explain your pricing strategy and unit economics
- Demonstrate path to profitability
- Detail how your prototype will evolve into a full product

## 8. Go-to-Market Strategy
- Detail your customer acquisition strategy
- Outline marketing and sales approaches
- Describe partnership opportunities
- Explain how you'll move from prototype to market-ready product

## 9. Traction and Milestones
- Highlight existing prototype feedback and testing results
- Set clear, achievable milestones for the next 6, 12, and 24 months
- Show development roadmap from current prototype to full product
- Outline key technical and business milestones

## 10. Financial Projections
- Create realistic financial forecasts (3-5 years)
- Include cash flow, income statements, and balance sheets
- Explain key assumptions underlying your projections
- Detail development costs for moving from prototype to production

## 11. Funding Requirements
- Specify how much capital you're seeking
- Explain how funds will be allocated (with specific emphasis on product development)
- Outline expected timeline to next funding round or profitability

## 12. Risk Assessment
- Identify potential obstacles and challenges (technical and business)
- Outline mitigation strategies
- Demonstrate thoughtful contingency planning

## 13. Technical Documentation Appendix
- Include a brief technical overview of your prototype
- List technologies used and development approach
- Provide setup instructions for localhost testing
- Outline known limitations and future development plans

## ADDENDUM: Demonstrating Evidence

Throughout your business plan and prototype presentation:

1. **Show your working prototype** - Prepare a clear demo that showcases core functionality
   
2. **Document technical validation** - Include performance metrics, test results, or user feedback
   
3. **Use visual data** - Charts, graphs, and infographics make market trends and opportunities instantly clear
   
4. **Provide concrete examples** - Instead of saying "our solution saves time," specify "reduces processing time from 3 hours to 15 minutes"
   
5. **Incorporate user feedback** - Early user feedback from prototype testing adds credibility
   
6. **Document team achievements** - Quantify previous technical and business successes
   
7. **Use case studies** - Show your prototype solving real problems in test scenarios
   
8. **Demonstrate market validation** - Include evidence of customer discovery interviews, waitlists, or pre-orders

Remember, successful onboarding requires both a compelling business case and tangible evidence of technical execution. Your working prototype validates your ability to deliver on your business vision, while your business plan demonstrates the commercial viability of your concept.
